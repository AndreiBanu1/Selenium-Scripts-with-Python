Each test case is implemented in a separate Python file and is fully commented to explain what the code is doing.

## Usage 
To run a test case, simply navigate to the directory where the Python file is located and run it using the Python interpreter. For example:

Copy code python login_test.py <br>
Before running a test case, make sure to update the variables at the top of the file with the appropriate values for your environment.
